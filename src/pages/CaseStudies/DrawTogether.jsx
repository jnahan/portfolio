            Creating art is a fun and relaxing way to express yourself, but it’s an activity that’s often done alone. To make art a more collaborative experience, I created Draw Together, a game that allows players to work together to create unique and meaningful art. This project took two months to design, develop, and user test.

          <p className="section__text">
            Through competitive analysis, we knew our idea had potential. Collaborative drawing seemed to be effective in making art more fun! <br /> <br />

            We used this knowledge to guide our ideation and came up with three game ideas: Draw Together, Canvas Swap, and Top Bottom. <br /> <br />

            <strong>Draw Together:</strong> draw with other players in real-time <br />
            <strong>Canvas Swap:</strong> digitized version of the painting swap challenge <br />
            <strong>Top Bottom:</strong> players draw on separate parts of the canvas <br /> <br />

            With these ideas, <strong>we also aimed to solve problems found in the games and challenges we analyzed.</strong> We could eliminate cheating in games like Skribbl.io by promoting collaboration rather than competition and remove the mess and cost of traditional art. <strong>We also wanted to create a friendly, easy-to-use interface so users of all skill levels can enjoy our games.</strong>

            As we are a small team, we needed to define our MVP to save time and validate our ideas. <br /> <br />

            We set aside ideas like real time-chatting and customizable game settings for future iterations. We decided on creating a simple desktop web app that let users create and join rooms with one other player, choose a game option, then play the game with simple drawing tools.

              We started off with a low fidelity wireframe to define our vision as a team. I worked with one other designer on the wireframes. <br /> <br />

              Upon discussion, we chose to remove the tutorial animations due to time constraints and removed the ability to name the room to simplify the setup process. We also decided to replace the rectangular canvas with a square one to better accommodate mobile users in future iterations. The drawing tool icons felt unclear, so we decided to redesign the palette to be more intuitive. These changes are reflected in our final mockup.

To address this issue, we added a popup with a quick tutorial and information about the other player. This popup can help users understanding the game mechanics and verify that they are match with the correct partner.

          <p className="section__text">
            This project was particularly fulfilling as it allowed me to bring a fun idea I had to life, and I learned a lot in the process. It was my teammate's and my first time using React, Socket, and Node, meaning we had to learn a lot of new tools in the process. I am incredibly proud that we were able to learn new frameworks and apply them within such a tight timeline. <br /> <br />

            Here are some of my takeaways: <br /> <br />

            <strong>Don't let your skills limit you</strong> <br />
            My teammates and I initially thought that we wouldn't be able to complete this project because we never created a full-stack application before and we had no experience with the programming frameworks we were using. I was also nervous because it was my first time developing a large project I designed on Figma. However, we pushed through and completed the project, and was able to grow and challenge ourselves through the process. <br /> <br />

            <strong> Knowing how to code is extremely helpful as a designer</strong> <br />
            
            Before I decided to focus on design, I felt conflicted because I enjoyed both design and coding. However, this project made me realize that having knowledge in both areas is hugely beneficial. I can create self-directed projects and this knowledge helps me bridge the gap between design and development. I had a better understanding of what steps were needed to build the project, and I could even provide some code instructions along with my design document to help the team work more quickly and efficiently.
